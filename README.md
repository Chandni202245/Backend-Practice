# Backend Practice – Django REST Framework

This repository contains my **backend practice work using Django and Django REST Framework (DRF)**.  
The goal of this project is to build strong backend fundamentals by implementing real-world APIs step by step and maintaining consistent daily progress.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- Python
- Django
- Django REST Framework (DRF)
- SQLite (for development)
- Postman (API testing)
- Git & GitHub

## 🔑 Features Implemented

### ✅ Health Check API
- Verifies that the Django REST API is running correctly

### ✅ User CRUD APIs
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete users
- Uses Django REST Framework function-based views

### ✅ Pagination
- Custom pagination using `PageNumberPagination`
- Improves performance for large datasets
- Returns:
  - total count
  - next & previous page links
  - paginated results

### ✅ Proper HTTP Status Codes
- `200 OK`
- `201 CREATED`
- `204 NO CONTENT`
- `400 BAD REQUEST`
- `404 NOT FOUND`

### ✅ Error Handling
- Safe object retrieval using `get_object_or_404`
- Serializer-based validation
- Clean API responses

## 🧪 API Testing
All APIs have been tested using **Postman** to ensure:
- Correct request handling
- Proper responses
- Accurate status codes
